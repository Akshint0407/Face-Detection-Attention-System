Face Recognition Attendance System

üìÑ Overview

This project is an automated attendance system that uses face recognition to identify individuals from a live video feed and logs their attendance in real time. Built using Python, OpenCV, and face recognition libraries, this system is efficient, easy to use, and features voice notifications for a more interactive experience.

üöÄ Features

- Real-Time Face Detection: Detects and captures faces in real-time via a webcam.
- Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a pre-stored database of images.
- Automated Attendance Logging: Logs each recognized individual‚Äôs name and timestamp in a CSV file.
- Voice Notification: Announces the name of each recognized person for instant verification.

 ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.	Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance-system.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance-system
2.	Install Dependencies: Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Add Photos:
‚Ä¢	Place images of each user in the photos folder.
‚Ä¢	Name each image according to the person‚Äôs name, e.g., elon_musk.jpg.
4.	Run the System:
python main.py
 ```
2.Install Dependencies: Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add Photos of Users:

3.Place clear, well-lit images of each individual in the photos folder.
Name each image according to the person‚Äôs name (e.g., elon_musk.jpg).

4.Run the System:
python main.py

**Usage**
1.	Run main.py: Start the program by running main.py.
2.	Camera Activation: The webcam will activate and begin detecting faces.
3.	Automatic Logging: Recognized faces are logged in a CSV file with names and timestamps.
4.	Exit: Press q to stop the program.
**Troubleshooting**
‚Ä¢	Face Not Recognized: Ensure the images in photos/ are clear and properly named.
‚Ä¢	Voice Notification Not Working: Verify pyttsx3 installation and functionality.
‚Ä¢	CSV Not Logging: Confirm correct file path in the code for the CSV file.
